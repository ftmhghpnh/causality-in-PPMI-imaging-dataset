Course project of ML in healthcare, fall 2021
- Conducted supervised experiments using machine learning algorithms to investigate the detection of MRI acquisition parameters in medical imaging for Parkinson's disease using the PPMI dataset.
- Demonstrated the ability of ML and DL models to identify variations in the images beyond medical conditions, highlighting the need to account for potential biases in the data and optimize models for improved performance.
